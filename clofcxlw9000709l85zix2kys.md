## What is Agile Methodology🔄🛠️🤝📈

Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative way for software development lifecycle. 🔄🚀📊💻🔁🤝. Its main focus is Delivering quickly with excellence and Customer Satisfaction by 🧩 Breaking Down larger problems into smaller chunks, Adapting the new Change, and Ensuring High-Quality Products 🛠️

🎯 **Agile Methodology** 🎯

Agile methodology 🔄 where the development team and customers work closely together, continuously adjusting their moves to create a perfect product. 🤝📊🛠️🔄🎯🚀

🔄 *Iterative and Incremental*:

* Agile is like a continuous loop in the software development life cycle, where we make small improvements with each cycle for faster delivery with efficient results.
    

🏉 **Scrum:**

* Scrum is one of the most popular Agile frameworks. It involves breaking a project into some MVP & fixed-length time frames called sprints, typically every sprint timeframe is 2-4 weeks. 🗓️ The team plans, 💡 builds, 🧪 tests, and delivers the product at the end of each sprint. 🚀📦 .🚀📦 If new feature requirements come from the client side, they can be added in the next sprint. 🔄📝
    

🔔 *Sprint*:

* A short, time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) in which a team works on a specific set of tasks.
    

🚀 *Example: Building a Website* 🌐

1. **Sprint 1**:
    
    * User Story: "As a user, I want a homepage with a logo and navigation links."
        
    * The team designs and creates the homepage.
        
2. **Sprint 2**:
    
    * User Story: "As a user, I want to see product categories on the homepage."
        
    * The team adds product categories.
        
3. **Sprint 3**:
    
    * User Story: "As a user, I want a shopping cart to add products."
        
    * The team implements the shopping cart.
        
4. **Sprint 4**:
    
    * User Story: "As a user, I want a payment system."
        
    * The team adds payment functionality.
        

🔄 After each sprint, the team evaluates the progress, gathers feedback, and adjusts the product backlog for the next sprint. if some task is not complete by the first sprint it will added to the next sprint.

📝 *User Stories*:

* Think of these as tasks written from the user's perspective, describing what they want to achieve.
    
* Duration to complete a story point
    
    3 points = 1 day
    
    5 points = 2 days
    
    8 points = 3 days
    
* All story point depends on the job role.
    

🗂 *Product Backlog*:

* A list of all the tasks or features to be completed, prioritized by importance.
    

🌟 **Benefits of Agile** 🚀

* 📈 Faster Time to Market - so you can launch your product quickly in the market.
    
* 🎯 Greater Flexibility - with market feedback we can quickly add new features
    
    those previously not planned.
    
* 🔄 Continuous Improvement - if some error we found after the first sprint we
    
    add it into next sprint.
    
* 👥 Enhanced Collaboration - by this multiple teams give their valuable input on
    
    that particular project.
    
* 📊 Adaptability to Change - Replace old development life-cycle with new.
    

🚫 **Challenges of Agile** 🤔

* 💼 Requires Strong Team Collaboration
    
* 📅 Frequent Changes May Be Disruptive
    
* 📊 Limited Predictability in Long-Term Planning
