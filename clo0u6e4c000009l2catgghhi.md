What is DevOps?

DevOps is a methodology that builds collaboration between the Development Team & Operation Team as a result it speeds up the development and deployment Process.

### Why DevOps Introduced?

Previously when the developer gave the code to the operation team for further deployment at the time code was not running in their system there were many reasons one of them being the required version mismatch .so in that case operation team again needed to come to the Development team and it's a time consuming task that's why DevOps introduced to minimize the whole process with best result with use some tools like Jenkins, Docker, Chef, Ansible etc.

### What is Automation Scaling infrastructure?

The goal of automation is to reduce manual & repeated tasks with some automation tools so it will be easy to handle the whole process.

There are Two Types of Scaling

* Horizontal Scaling:- When your Website has more traffic is there in that case to handle traffic you can launch multiple VM machines.
    
* Vertical Scaling:- When your Website has more traffic, in that case, to handle the traffic you can add more hardware to the existing machine.
