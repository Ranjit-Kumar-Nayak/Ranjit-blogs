DevOps: 🤝Where the Development Team and operation Team collaborate for faster development and deployment! 🚀

DevOps: 🤝 Dev Team + Ops Team = 🚀 Faster Product Release! 🚀👨‍💻🔧📦

### Revolutionizing IT: 🚀 The Birth of DevOps

"🕐 DevOps: Bridging the Gap 🛠️

In the past, Devs & Ops hit roadblocks 🚧 due to version mismatches and endless back-and-forth. 🔄

Enter DevOps 🚀, armed with tools like Jenkins, Docker, Chef, and Ansible, simplifying and speeding up the process! 💪👨‍💻🔧📦"

**<mark>example -:)</mark>**

Previously when the developer gave the code to the operation team for further deployment process at the time code was not running in their system many reasons will be there one of them being the required version mismatch. In that case operation team again needed to come to the Development team and it's a time-consuming task that's why DevOps was introduced which improves overall productivity 🔧💻🔍 automates the build & deployment process. we should quickly deliver the project.

### \*\*What is Automation Scaling infrastructure?\*\*🚀

The goal of automation is to reduce manual & repeated tasks with some automation tools so it will be easy to handle the whole process.

There are Two Types of Scaling

* <mark>Horizontal Scaling</mark>:- When your Website has more traffic is there in that case to handle traffic you can launch multiple VM machines.
    
* <mark>Vertical Scaling</mark>:- When your Website has more traffic, in that case, to handle the traffic you can add more hardware to the existing machine.
